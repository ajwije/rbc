Hi RADIANT members,

Just a quick notice to say that we are organizing an "Advanced R"
Software Carpentry bootcamp to be hosted here at UZH on November
6th/7th (Thu/Fri).  There are only 30 total spots available (well, ~25
now) and if you are interested in coming, you can register at this
link:

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zurich-software-carpentry-advanced-r-bootcamp-registration-12334106645[1]

Note: we assume that you are already a intermediate-level R user and
are comfortable with Unix (we will have a virtual machine OR you can
use your own laptop) as NO BASICS WILL BE COVERED.  It will be taught
by Laurent Gatto and Robert Stojnic (and hopefully one other helper).
The exact material is still not precisely defined, but will include
some of these topics:

- Makefiles (SC requirement)
- classes - S3, S4 == ~ 1/2 day
- package development == ~ 1/2 day
- functional programming
- reproducible research
- roxygen for documentation
- "Topics": Rcpp + BiocParallel + github == ~ 1/2 day or a bit less

Some material from earlier (similar) courses is available:

I will leave registrations open for the next week (until 17.00 9th
Sept) and if it's not full, I will open it to local UZH labs.

Cheers, Mark
