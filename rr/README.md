advocate RR:

  Buckheit and Donoho (35) , referring to the work and philosophy of
  Claerbout, state the following principle: "An article about
  computational science in a scientific publication is not the
  scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The
  actual scholarship is the complete software development environment
  and that complete set of instructions that generated the figures."

To facilitate reproducibility, we also want automation.
